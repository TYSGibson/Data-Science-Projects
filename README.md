# Finding the Best Choclate Bar (EDA Project)
My first data science project! A simple EDA project that I have completed by breaking down and analyzing data utilizing several Python modules (Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib etc). More to come!

## ðŸ“– Background
You work at a specialty foods import company that wants to expand into gourmet chocolate bars. Your boss needs your team to research this market to inform your initial approach to potential suppliers.

After finding valuable chocolate bar ratings online, you need to explore if the chocolate bars with the highest ratings share any characteristics that could help you narrow your search for suppliers (e.g., cacao percentage, bean country of origin, etc.)
